This paper compares different Optical Flow based algorithms to estimate the state vector of the drone. The optical flow technique is pouplar in GPS denied environments and applications where better positional precision is required. The comparison is based on Quality and Computation Time. The algorithms that are evaluated are Lucas-Kanade method, Gunnar-Farneback's method and Block Matching.

Background and Test Setup
------

The Goal of the optical flow system is to measure the x, y and rotational positional change of the drone using the downward facing camera on the drone. The real world position change is calculated from change in the pixel location of the subsequent image frames using the parameters - Height of the drone from the ground plane, pixel size and focal length of the camera sensor.

All the 3 algorithms were implemented using OpenCV library. Three different datasets were generated from three different environments (Both indoor and outdoor) for diversity. An Intel i5-4300U based system was used to perform the tests.

Experiments and Results
------

**Test1: CPU Processing Time**

The outdoor grass dataset was used and 50 frames were processed in order to measure the average computation time. Shi-Tomansi corner detectors were used to feed the location of features to Lucas-Kanade method.

Lucas-Kanade and Farneback outperform simple Block Matching in terms of execution time.

Farneback method is faster than Lucas-Kanade when the binning is a factor of 2.

**Test2: Quality Comparison**

The flow for Lucas-Kanade and Block Matching were sometimes too far off in indoor environments (Dotted floor and carpet floor). The dotted floor proved to be harder for all the algorithms, especially for Block Matching since it searches only locally, the algorithm assigns wrong flow vector. 
On the other hand, all the algorithms worked well on the natural grass dataset.

Farneback performs excellent for all the binning factors while Lucas-Kanade fails when a binning factor of 8 is applied as the corner detector doesn't find enough good points.

Conclusion and Future work
------

Experiments prove that different algorithms perform differently based on the type of ground surface. Although, in general, the *Farneback method performs better than the other 2 algorithms*.

New algorithms such as SimpleFlow, a 2D dense optical flow by M. W. Tao et al. can be tested. Only similarity transformation was considered and affine transformation was not taken into account.
